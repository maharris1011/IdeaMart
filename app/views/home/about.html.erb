		<h1>The Wisdom of Crowds</h1>
		<p class='lead'>Within organizations, many great ideas are lying just under the surface, waiting for someone to notice them, give them the light of day, and bring them to life.  Most of the time, it is the associates in a company who are closest to the issues who have the best 
		solutions.</p>
		<p class='lead'>We are all responsible for the success of Manta.  From the customer success team all the way through the customer pipeline to HR and Finance, we all have ideas that can help Manta
		grow and further our mission.  This web site is the collection of all our ideas.</p>
